  - title: "Why are Earth observation data important?"
    description: "For decades, airborne and spaceborne sensors have been acquiring data across all or part of Wales in varying modes and across a range of spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies. These sections provide information on and access to a range of data, much of which is in an analysis ready data (ARD) format.

    
    These data include freely accessible radar and optical data acquired by the Sentinel-1 and 2 respectively, which are provided in both near real time and as historical archives and can be downloaded at no cost. For more information on the ARD, go to [LINK TO DATA – ARD]"

    Submitted data are also transferred immediately to Natural Apptitude’s Coreo database, whereupon they are reviewed internally for record and image quality and content, and released within a day of submission to the Earthtrack Geoportal where they are available for download.
    
    
    All points can be downloaded from the Geoportal, but subsets can be selected by defining or drawing a region of interest. The direct access links are below:"
