  subtitle: "The most 'natural' reference state for sessile oakwoods in Wales are ravine woodlands in the most 'oceanic' west of the country. The best, and perhaps only, example is found at Devi's Bridge in Ceredigion. Here, the wood experiences high levels of humidity asa consequence of a waterfall running through the valley and remains unmanaged in terms of felling largely because of the steep nature of the valley sites. However, the steep-sided valley also prevents removal of unwanted species such as Rhododendron pontium.
