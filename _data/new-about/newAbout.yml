  subtitle: "Quantitative land cover contents and map generation through Living Earth."
  content: "Developing a fully quantititative approach to retrieving or classifying environmental descriptors and using these to construct land cover maps according to global taxonomies. Demonstration is for countries including Switzerland, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Wales and those in South America and Africa. Approaches to integrating uncertainty estimates are also being developed."

  subtitle: "Development of EODESM – the forerunner to Living Earth."
  content: "A large European-funded H2020 project that focuses its activities on a targeted set of internationally recognised Protected Areas, blending Earth Observations from remote sensing and field measurements, data analysis and modelling of current and future ecosystem conditions and services. ECOPOTENTIAL considers cross-scale geosphere-biosphere interactions at regional to continental scales, addressing long-term and large-scale environmental and ecological challenges. ECOPOTENTIAL followed BIOSOS and allowed the development of the Earth Observation Data for EcoSystem Monitoring (EODESM) and subsequently Living Earth"

  subtitle: "Mapping, monitoring and future planning of coastal ecosystems."
  content: "Adapting existing capacity to allow coastal and influencing inland landscapes to be consistently characterised, mapped and monitored from dense time-series of Earth observation data. Focusing on Australia, Wales (UK) and selected regions of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands and South America, Living Coasts is linking activities, events and processes on land with those occuring in the intertidal and subtidal zones."

  subtitle: "Applying Living Earth to freshwater environments."
  content: "Developing new capacity for characterising, mapping and monitoring catchments in Wales. The project is working alongside Living Wales, with focus on retrieving or classifying environmental descriptors relevant to freshwater systems from Earth observation data and quantifying and mapping change impacts and driving pressures.  The project is also developing new capacity for improving water quality and use through improved catchment management in Welsh river catchments."

- title: "DEA LAND COVER"
  image: "/assets/img/australia/australia_dea_a.png"
  subtitle: "Continental mapping of Australia for 33 years"
  content: "Generating the first national maps of Australia from 1988 to 2020 using Living Earth, with this providing remarkable and insightful history of land cover change for the continental land mass and islands.  The approach utilised environmental descriptors generated entirely from Landsat sensor data, including fractional vegetation cover and annual water hydroperiod, which were combined to generate the classifications of Australia.  The research and development was undertaken in parellel with Living Wales."

- title: "MAMAFOREST"
  image: "/assets/img/projects/mamaforest_a.png"
  subtitle: "Evaluating sustainable management of the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia"
  content: "Demonstrating new capacity for dynamic land cover change in commercial and protected mangroves from time-series of spaceborne radar and optical imagery. Provided opportunities to retrieve or classify a range of enviromental descriptors relevant to this landscape, including mangrove height, cover and biomass and dominant species. Indicators of change impacts, such as deforestation and regrowth were also mapped through comparisons of the time-series datasets, with this demonstrating capability for sustainable management of the mangroves to benefit local populations and nature."

  subtitle: "Land cover mapping from spectral data and derived metrics."
  content: "A pilot project to develop effective and timely multi-annual monitoring of European and NATURA 2000 sites and their surrounds in support to management decisions and reporting on the status and trends according to National and EU obligations. Focus was on the mapping of habitats in Europe from very-high resolution satellite sensor data, with focus on sites in the Mediterranean but also in Wales (United Kingdom). BIO_SOS was instrumental in developing the Living Earth approach."
