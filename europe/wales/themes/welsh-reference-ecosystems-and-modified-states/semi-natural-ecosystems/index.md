subheading="Wales has a diverse range of semi-natural ecosystems that exist primarily in a modified state, with these including forests, woodlands, scrub and bracken, grasslands, heaths and mires, fens and swamps, as well as standing water and water courses.  Around the coast, the main habitats are coastal dunes, cliffs, boulder fields and screens and those associated with intertidal areas.  Recognising the value of these habitats and providing a benchmark to inform and target restoration is essential, particularly as signficant knowledge has been lost over generations because many reference states no longer exist"
