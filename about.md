subheading="Our approach to consistent mapping land cover from Earth observations was conceptualised through collaborations between Australia and Europe (including the United Kingdom) and national application was first demonstrated for Wales (UK) and Australia. Time-series comparisons of the land cover maps and the environmental descriptors from which they were constructed led to the subsequent development of evidence-based detection and monitoring of change impacts and driving pressures.

count="Vision, We aspire to provide high-level, complex environmental dynamics datasets in an easy to use and understand format to everyone. To inspire, support and improve the way we plan landscape-scale change for biodiversity and resilience; Aims, Our long-term strategy is to provide ongoing, open-source datasets for any and all who want to use them from schools to scientists. Our vision is that providing complex landscape scale dynamics in accessible format will improve awareness of our changing environment while supporting decision-making for successful ecosystem conservation, restoration, and future planning for a better, more biodiverse world.; Values, We stand for free open-source collaboration of environmental dynamics across continents, disciplines and audiences. We seek better resources for land planners to be better prepared to face the challenges ahead from climate change, anthropogenic factors and natural disasters. Believe that collaborative responses to environmental change is our path to improving the environment.; Mission statement, Our mission is to provide the platform for landscape-scale environmental variable analysis, through time, to everyone for free. We take satellite data and process them to provide both analysis-ready data for developers and algorithm-based habitat dynamics map products. We are engineering a solution to visualising large-scale environmental changes, impacts and pressures to save our planet."
