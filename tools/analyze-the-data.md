first-content-top="Here, you can currently access the data cubes of satellite sensor data and derived products from Wales and Austraila​, where the Living Earth system is implemented.  "

first-content-bottom="​Select the country from the drop down menu and then sign in.  For Digital Earth Australia, you will need to first create an account at the link if you have not already done so.   For the Welsh Data Cube, you can request access by emailiing livingwales@aber.ac.uk.    When you sign in, you will have access to a historical but accumulating archive of satellite data and derived products, including environmental descriptors and the annual land cover maps constructed from these using the Living Earth system.   You can interrogate, process and analyses these within the data cubes without having to download any data to your own computer.   A wide range of Jupyter notebooks are avialabel which you can explore and use to build or modify your own.   "

second-heading="More on JupyterHub"
second-content-top="JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users      access to

      computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks.
      Users - including students, researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own workspaces on
      shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators.​"

second-content-bottom="JupyterHub runs in the cloud or on your own hardware, and makes it possible to serve a pre-configured data science

      environment to any user in the world. It is customizable and scalable, and is suitable for small and large teams,
      academic courses, and large-scale infrastructure.​"
