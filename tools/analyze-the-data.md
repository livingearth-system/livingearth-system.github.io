      shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators.​"

second-content-bottom="JupyterHub runs in the cloud or on your own hardware, and makes it possible to serve a pre-configured data science

      environment to any user in the world. It is customizable and scalable, and is suitable for small and large teams,
      academic courses, and large-scale infrastructure.​"
