Sustainability has been defined by the United Nations (UN) as the ability to meet our own needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN are the blueprint by which to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all and address challenges that include climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, poverty and peace and justice.
