Biodiversity accounts are tools and methods for quantifying the diversity of life in an area to evaluate its ecological health and the impacts of human activities. Specifically this usually transposes the valuing ecological systems into values or economical based format in order to protect them, Carbon calculations are an important emerging area of growth in this sector.  Environmental Accounting involves measuring various indicators, such as species richness, ecosystem stability, habitat distribution and dynamics, and genetic variability, to create comprehensive  assessments. This data is used to guide sustainable development, conservation efforts, and policy-making to preserve and restore natural habitats.

Living Earth habitat and environmental variable  mapping is a crucial tool in supporting environmental accounting by providing detailed spatial information on different habitats and their conditions. Here’s how it is being used:
Identification of Biodiversity Hotspots: Habitat mapping helps identify areas with high biodiversity, often leading to prioritizing these areas for conservation and targeted resource allocation.
Assessment of Habitat Quality and Size: By evaluating the size, quality, and interconnectedness of habitats, mapping supports the assessment of ecosystem health and viability, which are key components of biodiversity accounting.
Monitoring Changes Over Time: Habitat maps can be updated regularly to monitor the impact of environmental changes, human activity, and conservation efforts, providing a dynamic view of how biodiversity is preserved or altered.


Visualising landscape scale environmental variables and risk factors, such as waterlogged land and flood risk areas, to support holistic habitat planning for sustainable ecosystems into the future with climate change in mind. 
Overall, LivingEarth  habitat mapping enables more precise and effective biodiversity accounting by ensuring that assessments are grounded in the actual conditions of the ecosystems studied. This facilitates better-informed decision-making for environmental management and policy.
